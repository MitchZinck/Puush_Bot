Puush_Bot
=========

A bot that goes through random puu.sh images.

It is currently in an experimental stage as I programmed this around 6 months ago before puush.me purged there images,
making them more spread out and harder to find. I have changed my algorithm to match there new system, but it takes around 6-10 cycles to actually find a image.
